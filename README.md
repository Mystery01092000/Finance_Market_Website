People make the wrong financial decisions losing money saved for years. Loans are availed without understanding interest payments and the consequences of a default. People donâ€™t commit suicide if they are unwell; they commit suicide if they are in financial trouble. No financial education = No money for retirement. Lack of financial education is a heavy burden on the Nation, as expenses on financial security rise. This begs the question. How can India be made financially literate and achieve complete financial inclusion?

Now to the next big thing. Financial education can be a stepping stone to complete financial inclusion. Financial inclusion is making financial services like banking and insurance, available to all citizens of India at an affordable cost. A financially educated person knows the value of financial inclusion and this is the first step to financial inclusion.

In this project, we build a finance education website that can be used by all for learning about finance ,stock markets and basics such as accounting and basics of economics. This website would be built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. As we know, HTML is used to structure a website, CSS (cascading style sheets) are used to styling a webpage.
