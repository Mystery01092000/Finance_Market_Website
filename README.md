People make the wrong financial decisions losing money saved for years. Loans are availed without understanding interest payments and the consequences of a default. People donâ€™t commit suicide if they are unwell; they commit suicide if they are in financial trouble. No financial education = No money for retirement. Lack of financial education is a heavy burden on the Nation, as expenses on financial security rise. This begs the question. How can India be made financially literate and achieve complete financial inclusion?
